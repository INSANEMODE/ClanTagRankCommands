# ClanTagRankCommands

c# plugin for iw4m-admin that interacts with ClanTagRank to set the ClanTag of players, either by iw4m-admin permission level, or a custom one set with ```!setRank <player> <tag>```.


# Commands
```(!sr) !setRank <player> <tag>```
```(!rr) !ResetRank <player>```

# Installation
download the latest ClanTagRankCommands.dll from the releases page and place it in the Plugins folder of your iw4m-admin folder, and then head over to https://gitea.insanemode.org/INSANEMODE/ClanTagRank and follow the instructions there.

#Configuration
You can change the default rank names in ./Configuration/ClanTagRankCommands.json
if you do not have it, make sure you are up to date, and you run iw4m-admin to generate the default Configuration.
